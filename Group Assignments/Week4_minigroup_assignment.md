# Week 4 Mini Group Assignment
Group Members: Arturo Jacobo and Miranda Mead-Newton
# Project Title and Description
NextGen changes in bus service
Description of changes/status update: We are still thinking through our proposal and how to scale it back and make it feasible. We are still seeking a simple precedent for measuring the efficacy of the changes between the two bus networks. At the very least, weâ€™re thinking it would be interesting to map the two networks and look at the changes between them, weighted for the population in the surrounding areas of disappearing and added routes. 
# Roles
* Arturo- Finding data/design work lead

* Miranda- Coding lead (making coding look nice)
# Status Update
Morale and enthusiasm are high, clarity is a little lacking
# Data Update
We are currently exploring different options but our current plan will utilize similar data sources from before but paring it back to just these:

* Census tract population

* Next Gen Bus routes and frequencies

* Original bus routes and frequencies

(links from last proposal)
# Concerns
Major concern:

* Finding precedent for a really simplistic metric of bus accessibility/value (?) that takes into account ridership base and bus frequency 

* What do the changes between NextGen and the original bus line even look like? Will we find anything interesting?

Minor:

* Scale - are we going too big?
