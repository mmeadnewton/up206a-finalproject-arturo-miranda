    "# Bus Access and Income in Los Angeles: Final Notebook 2\n",
    "**_Arturo Jacobo & Miranda Mead-Newton_**\n",
    "\n",
    "For our final research project, we are exploring bus access and income in Los Angeles County, and have made recommendations according to our findings. Bus riders in Los Angeles are some of the most low-income populations in the City and changes are coming to the bus network. We sought to examine whether these planned changes are going to improve bus network coverage for low income populations. We found that very little coverage changes are planned for the new NextGen bus network. We examine the areas of the City we believe deserve higher coverage.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we dive into the changes in the new planned bus network: NextGen and develop a metric for bus access for the County. We then look at the spatial relationship between income and bus access through an interactive Kepler map. "

    "In our analysis of bus access in LA, we began by looking at the concentration of bus stops in the County. The map below uses a dataset of LA Metro bus stops for each bus line. If a bus stop serves multiple buses, it is weighted as such. This is a rough metric for access to the bus across the County. This map shows the median and mean center of bus stops and shows their distribution across a vertical and horizontal access. Using this map, we can see that bus stops are more heavily concentrated in the center of the City. The dip in the vertical distribution shows the lack of bus access in the hills between the valley and the center of the city. We sharpened our bus access metric by taking into account bus frequency in the next step."

    "One of the biggest challenges we ran into was developing a metric for bus access. We had quite a few limitations when using the data from Metro including a lack of information on the datasets and a lack of current data. The metric we settled on for bus access used bus stop information and headway data. We started with a dataset from Metro called Lines Serving Stops from June 2020. This dataset includes the geographic location of every bus stop in the existing LA Metro network data organized by bus line. This means that if a bus stop is served by four bus lines it will appear four times in the dataset. (Note that the description on the website for the Lines Serving Stops and Stops Serving Lines datasets are reversed). Just mapping this dataset gives a fairly good representation of bus access (more bus stops mean more bus lines and therefore greater access to the City).\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we appended the bus frequency data from the headways dataset (note that this data is from 2014 and discrepancies between 2014 and the above 2020 data resulted in some dropped bus stops). We totaled the number of buses that run on each line in a week during peak hours by summing the “total trips” by bus line and multiplying the weekday trips by five. Next, we assigned each bus stop with the total weekly trips that pass through it. Each of these weekly trips can be seen as an “opportunity” to take the bus. In a sense, we are measuring bus access by the number of buses that one has the chance to take during a week. This does not take into account where one might be able to take the bus, accessibility of various services or employment via the bus, bus wait time, bus reliability, or walking distance to the bus.\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "One area on this map of note is the Valley/North Hollywood. Though the Valley is served by the Orange and Red Lines, there are few options for crossing into Central LA and this commute can become very congested. We were interested in the fact that North Hollywood is characterized by lower incomes and low bus access. On the map on the right, you can see that some of the existing network will be removed in this area.\n",
    "\n",
    "Parts of South and East LA are also characterized by lower incomes. These areas have higher frequencies of bus service, however, most of the transit access in the area runs into Downtown LA. There is less neighborhood travel coverage in these areas. Though these bus lines run regularly, they are more spaced apart south of the 10 freeway. This area will also see some reduction in bus line coverage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Without being able to analyze frequency changes, it's clear that there are current areas characterized by low incomes and low level of bus service. From our research and findings, we know that low income populations tend to be most dependent on the bus and have less car access. These areas tend to be further away from the central city and likely commute into Central LA. Increasing service in these areas would be an easy way to reduce overall vehicle miles traveled (VMT). This is probably especially true in the Valley where there are few routes into the City. More bus access could greatly reduce peak rush hour congestion.\n",
    "\n",
    "In South LA, we noticed that most of the current service appears to serve those who want to travel to Downtown and Central LA. Most of the high level frequency bus routes travel North/South and those routes are closer together leading to greater coverage. This is useful for job access but may leave gaps for those who wish to travel within their neighborhood or run errands. This can further isolate those living in poverty from community and basic resources. There's also no easy route for those in South LA to travel to West LA or Century City, another job center.\n",
    "\n",
    "In East LA, there are areas characterized by lower incomes and a very sparse bus network. Similar, to South LA, travel is mostly aimed at commuters into downtown and there's very little opportunity for intra-community travel.\n",
